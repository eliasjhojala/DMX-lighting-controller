new ShapeTheme(color,       color,       int,          boolean);
new ShapeTheme(ColorTheme,  color,       int,          boolean);
new ShapeTheme(ColorTheme,  ColorTheme,  int,          boolean);
new ShapeTheme(color,       ColorTheme,  int,          boolean);

And here is explanations of variables
new ShapeTheme(fillColor,   strokeColor, strokeWeight, drawStroke);

If you use color it don't change if object is hovered or clicked
If you use ColorTheme it changes when object is hovered or clicked

When you want to set some theme to your code you only have to 
call function themes.themeName.setTheme(g, mouse, isHovered, isPressed);
or function   themes.themeName(g, mouse);

Creating colorTheme is pretty easy also. It can be created calling function
new ColorTheme(neutralColor, hoveredColor, activeColor);
