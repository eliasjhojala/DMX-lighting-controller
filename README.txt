This project is made to control DMX ligting systems from computer.
It's designet to use with Enttec DMX usb pro as input and Arduino with DMX shield as output,
but of course you can use any devices you want to.
There is also iPad input allowed in this program.
Original I made this program for only myself, so for the begin it would be really difficult
to use and change settings in it.
