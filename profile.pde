- add fixtureType button opens menu which ask following things
- fixtureName? --> textbox which data is saved into fixtureName variable
- fixtureLongName? --> textbox which data is saved into fixtureLongName variable
- fixtureBrand --> textbox which data is saved into fixtureBrand variable
- add channel button --> ask what kind of channel this channel is
    --> user can add as many channels as he wants
    --> select some of the followings
    --> finally save selected channels as array channelNames and channelTypes
- ask user to stretch square as big as he wants
    --> save data as fixtureSize size = new fixtureSize(w, h, true);
- fixtureProfiles[id] = new FixtureProfile(fixtureName, fixtureLongName, fixtureBrand, channelNames, channelTypes, size);
